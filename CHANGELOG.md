Charitable submission. I made a few changed to the repo by adding new Contact events, modifier, functions, and also removed some repeated functions to make the contract more seamless and charitable. With the smart contract changes, I optimized the dApp frontend by editing the App.js file to fix the charity amount paid bug when buying a book, the donated funds analytics, the book image not displaying bug, and other interface changes.

Below are listed contributions made to the repo.

### Added

* EditorConfig file
* CHANGELOG.md file to study repo updates

### Changed

* Restructured file directories
* Contracts with it's JSON abi files
